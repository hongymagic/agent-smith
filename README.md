# Agent Smith

*Agent Smith* is yet another `user-agent` spoofer extension for Chrome browser. Major difference between *Agent Smith* and the others that exist out there are:

1. *Agent Smith* keeps track of `user-agents` per tab; and
2. At this stage, it is a hell of a lot less complicated than others.

# How to install

There are two major versions of "Agent Smith". To find out which one is suitable, you first need to find the version number of your Chrome browser. To do so:

	`Settings` -> `About Google Chrome`
